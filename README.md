Release engineering resources to support open source software projects provided by [TCAT](http://tcat.tamu.edu/) (Texas
Center for Applied Technology).

This project contains an [Equinox p2 Repository](http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/p2/) for use with [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
Target Platform configurations or [Tycho](https://eclipse.org/tycho/) dependency configurations.

The p2 Repository contains two index files, `artifacts.jar` and `contents.jar`, and a directory of `plugins/` and of `features/`.

This repository is periodically updated with the OSS libraries provided by TCAT as they go through individual
releases.
